Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML models improve their performance by analyzing examples, making it useful for tasks like classification, prediction, recommendation, and pattern detection. ML generally includes supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through rewards). It follows a workflow of collecting data, training models, evaluating performance, and improving accuracy, and is widely used in fields such as healthcare, finance, automation, and technology.
