    Deep Learning/Neural Network Fundamentals
    Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known as artificial neural networks. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information hierarchically. While traditional machine learning may struggle with unstructured data like images or audio, deep learning excels at automatically extracting features through its multi-layered architecture. This ability to learn complex, non-linear representations makes deep learning the foundation for modern breakthroughs in computer vision, autonomous driving, and advanced speech synthesis.
