    Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the domain of AI concerned with the interaction between computers and human language. It combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human text and speech. NLP tasks range from basic operations like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to complex challenges such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question-answering. By bridging the gap between human communication and computer understanding, NLP enables technologies like virtual assistants, chatbots, and real-time language translators."
